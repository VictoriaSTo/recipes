    recipe: `
    STEP 1
    Heat the oil in a small non-stick frying pan, then cook the tomatoes cut-side down until starting to soften and colour. Meanwhile, beat the eggs with the herbs and plenty of freshly ground black pepper in a small bowl.
    STEP 2
    Scoop the tomatoes from the pan and put them on two serving plates. Pour the egg mixture into the pan and stir gently with a wooden spoon so the egg that sets on the base of the pan moves to enable uncooked egg to flow into the space. Stop stirring when it’s nearly cooked to allow it to set into an omelette. Cut into four and serve with the tomatoes.

    recipe: `
    STEP 1
    Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Toss the onion, tomatoes, 2 tbsp curry paste, the chickpeas and 200ml water together in a deep 20 x 25cm roasting tin. Roast for 15 mins until the onions are tender and the tomatoes are just bursting.
    STEP 2
    Stir everything, then season. Brush the remaining curry paste over the salmon fillets and season. Nestle the salmon into the veg in the tin and roast for another 8-10 mins, or until cooked to your liking.
    STEP 3
    Meanwhile, warm the naan breads – you can do this by putting them directly on the oven rack below the roasting tin. Cut the warmed naan breads into wedges. Swirl the yogurt into the veg in the tin, then serve with the naan wedges for dunking, a few coriander leaves sprinkled over, if you like, and the lemon wedges, if using, for squeezing over.

    recipe: `
    STEP 1
    Heat 1 tsp oil in a large pan, then add the leeks and stir-fry until softened and charred around the edges. Tip in the mushrooms and cook until softened.
    STEP 2
    Stir in the rice and thyme sprigs with the bouillon powder, then pour in 700ml boiling water. Cover and leave to simmer for 30 mins.
    STEP 3
    While the rice is cooking, mix the ricotta with the basil, garlic and parmesan. Cut a slash in the top of each chicken breast, then slightly open out and spoon on the ricotta mix. Heat the remaining 1½ tsp oil in a small frying pan, then add the chicken, ricotta-side up. Cover with a lid and cook over a low heat for 10 mins. Once cooked, turn off the heat and leave while you wait for the rice to finish cooking.
    STEP 4
    Pour any juices from the chicken into the rice, then cook for 5 mins more to get rid of any excess moisture. Stir the parsley through the rice, remove the thyme sprigs and spoon onto two plates, top with the chicken, and scatter over the basil and more parsley leaves.
